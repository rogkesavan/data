Honourable Speaker!
‘இன்ச ொல் விளைநிலமொ ஈதலல வித்துஆக
வன்ச ொல் களைகட்டு வொய்ளம எருவட்டி
அன்புநீர் பொய்ச்சி அறக்கதிர் ஈனஓர்

Our

Honourable

Chief

Minister

who

lives

in

testimony of the above lines, has endowed upon me this
rare opportunity of presenting the third agriculture budget
to this august assembly, today.
I remain ever indebted for the same, to our
Honourable Chief Minister and to all those farmers who
toil with the soil and start my speech.
From being a nomad, man started settling down in
the banks of rivers, as agriculture is predominantly based
on the availability of water. Those animals that followed
him from the forests, became domesticated by him. He
started using more of the spade and less of the spear.
Arrows became less useful to him than the crowbars that
he used to till the land. From using stones as instruments,
he began to use the plough. Became less dependent on
hunting for his food and therefore moved from killing to
tilling.
The fundamental need of food remains unshakable
for man, no matter how well he progresses in any other
field. Even the mightiest of men when deprived of food
become mentally disoriented. Food, it's presence and

2
absence decide one's feelings and emotions. The Tamil
poet Avvaiyaar describes in the lines below
‘மொனம் குலம்கல்வி வண்ளம அறிவுளைளம
தொனம் தவம் உயர்ச்சி தொைொண்ளம லதேன் கசிவந்த ச ொல்லியர்லமல் கொமுறுதல் பத்தும்
பசிவந் திைப்பறந்து லபொம்’
That man loses everything (all the ten virtues such
as

Esteem,

class,

education,

might,

cognition,

Philanthropy, austerity, majesty, persistence, lewd for
sweet nothings) when hunger strikes.
Tamil literature has well documented the fact that
agriculture is the lifeline of the Tamils. The Sangam
literature

cites

numerous

references

to

agriculture.

Thiruvalluvar in his famous work Thirukkural has devoted
an entire chapter to agriculture. The Athichudi advises to
‘Till the land in the right season, and ‘Plough the land and
eat’. Kondraivendhan notes the significance of water for
habitation.
Ancient literature documents the fact that the
Tamils have endowed great significance to agriculture.
It is to be noted that scholars abroad also hail the
importance of agriculture. ‘Agriculture is not just a job,
it’s a way of life’ says Louis Thompson. Dr Samuel
Johnson,

called

‘Agriculture

Masanobu

Fukuoka

who

the

advanced

noblest

science’.

natural

farming

proclaimed, ‘The ultimate goal of farming is not the
growing of the crops, but the cultivation and perfection of
human beings.’

3
Bearing in mind the essence of all the above, the
third Agriculture Budget is being presented to the House.
The last two Agriculture Budgets were presented with the
objective to ensure that the farmers get their due returns,
earn an income that is commensurate with their labour,
use scientific methods in agriculture, integrate technology
in farming and achieve high production targets.
Challenges in the field of agriculture
Agriculture has become hide and seek with Nature.
Farmers are faced with a myriad challenge. Agricultural
land is being converted into habitats. The acreage of land
under agriculture is fast declining. Hence, increasing
productivity

is

the

need

of

the

hour.

It

becomes

imperative to develop varieties that survive well in dry
land

thereby

productivity

of

such

land

improves.

Developing crop varieties that survive drought and brave
floods is a requirement born out of the unwelcome
climatic changes. An important challenge in achieving
nutritional security is not only in increasing cultivation of
grains and vegetables but also in fruits. Consuming
carbohydrates alone will only lead to fat deposits and
therefore

proteins,

vitamins,

fibres,

minerals

and

amino acids need to be balanced in one's diet to attain
nutritional security.
Producing enough raw materials for industries is
a major responsibility of the Department of Agriculture.
During the year 2021-22 several long-term schemes were

4
implemented on the lines of the above and as a
result of it, 1.93 lakh hectare of additional land was
brought under agriculture resulting in a crop coverage of
63.48 lakh hectare.

The soil remains to be the foundation for agriculture
and only nutrient-rich soil can help increase agricultural
productivity. The Government is implementing various
schemes to improve the quality of soil without depleting
its nutrients. Soil samples collected from farming areas
are tested, and based on the results, recommendations
are made for suitable fertilizers and other nutrients
required for different crops. Soil health cards are also
being

distributed.

During

2021-22,

due

to

soil

conservation and fertility enhancement practices indulged
with, a food grain production of 119 lakh and 97 thousand
metric tonne was achieved after six years. I would like to
mention that this is 11 lakh and 73 thousand metric
tonnes more than the year 2020-21.

5
Depleting water resources:
The poet Ilangovadigalaar, in the preface to his epic
Silapathikaaram, praised rain as
‘மொமளை லபொற்றுதும் மொமளை லபொற்றுதும்

நொமநீர் லவலி உலகிற்கு அவன்அளிலபொல்
லமல்நின்று தொன்சுரத்த லொன்’
Rain is the elixir of soil. Even hundred irrigations
cannot substitute a thunder shower. Rain is the source of
rivers and the foundation for lakes.
Water is the lifeline of agriculture. In Puranaanooru,
the poet Kudapulavianar declares that ‘நீர்நிளலகளை
உருவொக்கும் மன்னலன, நீடித்த புகளை அளைய முடியும்’
Puranaanooru also states that food is a result of
both land and water. A combination of water and soil can
increase the food yield. So, the one who stored water in
the earth is the creator of life in a body as
‘உணவு எனப்படுவது நிலத்சதொடு நீலர;
நீரும் நிலனும் புணரிலயொர் ஈண்டு
உைம்பும் உயிரும் பளைத்திசிலனொலர;’
Ensuring
waterbodies,

availability
and

of

increasing

water,
their

protecting
capacity

is

the
our

responsibility. Tamil Nadu has been blessed with an
increased water table owing to several reasons such as
the desilting of the rivers, ponds and lakes, thereby
increasing

the

water

storage,

water

table

and

the seasonal monsoon. The honourable Chief Minister

6
ordered release of water from the Mettur Dam on the
12th June 2021 and 24th May 2022- a clear 19 days ahead
of

the

earmarked

date.

This

ensured

copious

uninterrupted water supply to the Cauvery Delta. The lush
green fields left the delta region like one big emerald.
In 2022-23, Kuruvai cultivation was done on 5.36 lakh
acre in the delta region. This created history and an
achievement in the last 47 years.
Electricity is a vital resource in utilizing ground
water. Water that flows above the ground gets easily
directed

by

man

to

areas

desired

by

him.

But

groundwater needs the help of electricity to be accessed
by man. Fields have been water fed over the last
two years owing to the 1.5 lakh new electricity
connections made as per the orders of the Hon’ble
Chief Minister which in turn facilitated the usage of
pump sets.
Youth

are

packed

with

energy;

they

are

a

storehouse of hope; an embodiment of zeal. Only when
the youth are motivated and involved in agriculture, can
new technological advancements and achievements in
agriculture be made possible. Only the youth dare to
undertake risky experiments. Keeping this in mind,
in 2021-22, 185 youngsters were selected and a grant of
one lakh Rupees each, was awarded to set up "Agri
Clinic" and other agro-businesses.

7
Farmers will feel encouraged only if they are
guaranteed

remunerative

prices

for

their

produce.

With this in the backdrop, Paddy is procured from the
farmers through the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation
at a price over and above the Minimum Support Price.
In an unprecedented manner, the Direct Purchase Centres
have been setup in huge numbers, which has significantly
benefited farmers. In addition, farmers have access to
technological advancements and a free market.
Apart from Paddy, pulses and copra are being
procured. For Sugarcane, procurement is done by giving
Rs.195

per

Sandhais,

Metric

Electronic

additionally.

Markets

(eNAM)

The
and

Uzhavar
Regulated

Markets are functioning to ensure remunerative prices for
the produce.
Using machines instead of humans for harvesting,
threshing, and drying is easier and less laborious.
It is also cost-effective and all types of machinery needed
for farming are provided to farmers at a reasonable cost.
Agricultural Machinery Custom Hiring Centres have been
set up to offer these machineries to farmers on a rental
basis.
The Government continues to take measures for the
welfare of farmers and has created new cold storages,
grain storage godowns and drying yards, to prevent the
wastage of the produce got through the sweat and
sleepless nights of farmers.

8
To protect farmers' livelihood from loss of income
due to natural calamities, under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal
Bima Yojana, during 2021-22, 26 lakh farmers have
registered an area of 40.74 lakh acre. The Government
of Tamil Nadu has given Rs.1,695 crore as insurance
premium subsidy and so far, Rs.783 crore has been
given as compensation to 6.71 lakh farmers.
Relief for an amount of Rs.163.6 crore as input
subsidy has been given to 1.82 lakh farmers from the
State Disaster Response Fund for the crops affected by
Northeast Monsoon, and unseasonal heavy rains in the
months of January and February 2023.
The practice of agroforestry improves the natural
environment by providing an emerald cover over the

It can generate considerable income for

farmers. Last year, 77 lakh high-quality tree saplings,
such as Sandalwood, Red Sanders, Mahogany, Teak etc,
were provided and planted in an area of 30,000 hectares.
In Digital Agriculture, with a view to provide
efficient Agricultural Services, 'Uzhavan App' is rendering
22 important agricultural services from seed to sale.
Except for the projects that require the approval of
the Union Government, Government Orders have been

Department

has

as

Agriculture-Farmers Welfare Department and it has been
functioning with a focus on elevating the farmers’ status.
Recognizing

the

inappropriateness

in

preparing

the

Agriculture Budget from within the confines of an office,
the Hon’ble Chief Minister advised that it should be
prepared after visiting the districts of Dindigul, Tirunelveli,
Mayiladuthurai, Chengalpattu, Chennai, Sivagangai along
with

my

department

officials

and

meeting

the agriculturists, traders and exporters, gathering their
opinions and ideas, hearing their concerns, receiving their
suggestions and considering their proposals. I would like
to highlight that the opinions of the farmers have been
incorporated into this Agriculture Budget.
Department of Agriculture
Agriculture is the mother of many departments and
the forerunner of many occupations. As water is essential
for soil fertility, integration of the water resources sector
becomes significant. The contribution of the livestock
sector is also essential as it supports farmers and
provides security for their livelihood. Collaboration with
the Cooperative sector is also required for selling produce
and supplying inputs. As the farmers contribute to rearing

10
fish in the ponds, the fisheries sector also needs to be
associated with. The Rural Development Department
is responsible for creating infrastructure in hamlets
to handhold the farmers. The Energy sector is also critical
to the lives of the farmers. The industrial sector should
also contribute to the processing and preservation of
agricultural products. Agriculture can only expand through
the efforts of multiple sectors.
In the ensuing year, a target of 127 lakh Metric
Tonne is set for total food grain production. I would also
like to mention the measures and plans that are being
undertaken to achieve such a great goal.
1.

Kalaignarin All Village Integrated Agricultural
Development Programme:
Each hamlet, according to its potential, can become

self-sufficient.

This

scheme

is

by Rural Development Department through convergence.
2.

Tamil Nadu Millet Mission
Pearl Millet, Finger Millet, Kodo Millet, Proso Millet,

Foxtail

Millet,

Barnyard

Millet

and

Little

Millet

are

classified as minor millets. The nutrient-rich millets,
besides growing well in drought conditions grow and
thrive in poor soil conditions too.
Hence, to revive millets in Tamil Nadu and to
increase the area under its cultivation, production and
consumption of Millets, two millet zones encompassing
20 districts were declared in the last Agriculture Budget.
Based on the representations received from farmers,
five new districts namely Namakkal, Tirupur, Coimbatore,
Erode and Pudukottai will be added.
To make millets available to people, steps are being
taken to distribute two kilograms of Ragi to family card
holders in Nilgiris and Dharmapuri districts on a pilot
basis. Also, to facilitate the farmers in getting fair price,
processed minor millets are procured through Cooperative
societies and distributed through Amutham, Chinthamani

13
and Kamadhenu Co-operative sales outlets in Chennai
and Coimbatore cities.
As

the

United

Nations

General

Assembly

has

declared the year 2023 as the “International Year of
Millets”, it is proposed to implement Tamil Nadu Millet
Mission for a period of five years. Under this scheme,
subsidy will be given for bringing Millet cultivation to
fallow

lands

and

crop

diversification

to

millets

in

50,000 acres. Hundred groups of millet producers will be
formed by bringing together millet farmers and training
programmes will be conducted for them. Subsidy will be
provided

to

install

Sprinkler

Irrigation

system

for

12,500 acres. Subsidy assistance will be provided to
farmer producer groups to set up Millets Processing
Centres for selling value added Millets.
Under

the

Tamil

Nadu

Millet

Mission,

“Millet

Festivals” are to be celebrated in order to create
awareness

among

consumers

and

increase

millet

consumption.
In the coming

year, the

scheme will

be

implemented with the financial assistance of the
Union and State Governments at an estimated cost
of Rs.82 crore.
To increase the production and consumption of
millets, Finger Millet and Pearl Millet will be directly
procured and availability of Millets will be ensured in fair
price

shops.

Millet

3.

State Agriculture Development Scheme
The State Agriculture Development Scheme is being

implemented

as

a

major

scheme

with

multifarious

components to meet out the immediate needs of farmers
and to increase their income. In the coming year, the
scheme

will

be

implemented

at

an

outlay

of

Rs.64 crore on the following components.
a.

Village Agricultural Development Group
To increase the income from crop cultivation, it is

imperative to provide timely information on crops suitable
to seasons, cultivation technologies, marketing avenues,
marketing after value addition to the farmers. Village
Agricultural Development Groups will be formed in all
village panchayats, covering all the hamlets over a period
of five years. The group will consist of 25 to 50 farmers
from all categories as members.
In the coming year, in the first phase, groups will
be

formed

in

the

2,504

village

Panchayats

where

Kalaignarin All Village Integrated Agriculture Development
Programme is implemented and they will be given
trainings. An amount of Rs.2.5 crore will be allocated
towards the formation and training of these groups.

15
b.

Nel Jeyaraman Traditional Paddy Varieties
To conserve and propagate Tamil Nadu's traditional

Rice varieties like Thuyamalli, Seeraga Samba, Mappillai
Samba, Karuppu Kavuni, Kichili Samba, Thanga Samba
and Keerai Samba, about 196 metric tonnes of these
seeds have been distributed to the farmers at subsidized
cost during 2021-22 under Nel Jayaraman Traditional Rice
Varieties Conservation Mission. Similarly, this year too,
seeds will be produced in an area of 200 acres in
Government seed farms and distributed to farmers at
subsidized rates. Rs.50 lakh will be allocated for this
purpose.
Also, 10 farmers who have Traditional Rice Seed
Bank will be given Rs.30 lakh each at the rate of three
lakh rupees in the coming year to encourage the farmers
who are maintaining traditional rice seeds with ethnic
purity and providing them to the farmers.
c. Rewards to Best Performing Farmers
The Tamil Nadu Government offers cash award of
five lakh rupees to the farmer with the highest yield in
rice crop at State level. Since all crops are considered
important, cash awards of five lakh rupees will be given to
all farmers who achieve highest productivity in other
crops such as pearl millet, finger millet, foxtail millet, little
millet, barnyard millet, Red gram, Black gram, Green

16
gram, Groundnut, Gingelly and Sugarcane, from the
coming year onwards.
Awards to field officials, Block and District level
Officers

who

contribute

towards

achieving

highest

production and productivity in food grain crops shall be
given away from the coming year onwards.
d.

Alternative Crop cultivation during Kuruvai
season
Crop

rotation

enriches

soil

and

increases

the

productivity. To achieve this, an amount of Rs.16 crore
will be allocated in the coming year to encourage the
cultivation of less water requiring crops like Millets, Pulses
and Oilseeds during Kuruvai season in an area of one lakh
acres.
e.

Crop cultivation after Paddy
In Tamil Nadu, crop rotation has been in practice

even in Sangam era. Sowing Millets, Pulses, Oilseeds and
Cotton using the residual moisture before harvesting the
Paddy crop was done. To further expand and enrich this
practice, assistance for cultivating these crops after paddy
will be given to cover an area of six lakh acres in the
coming year for which an allocation of Rs.24 crore will be
made.
f.

Making Youth into Agri – Entrepreneurs
In

order

self-reliant

and

to

make

evolve

the
as

agricultural

graduates

entrepreneurs,

financial

assistance at the rate of two lakh Rupees will be extended

17
to 200 young Agricultural and Horticulture graduates to
establish Agri-clinics or any other Agriculture related
business for which four crore Rupees will be allocated.
Seed, Fertiliser, Pesticide licence will be issued to the
selected beneficiaries as per their requirement.
g.

Distribution of Farm Implement kits
To help and improve the efficiency of farmers in the

traditional agricultural operations, 60,000 agricultural
implement kits will be distributed to small and marginal
farmers and landless agricultural labourers at an outlay of
Rs.15 crore. Particularly, a minimum of 30,000 kits will be
provided to landless agricultural labourers.
4)

Promotion of Organic Farming
a) Excessive use of chemicals increases the soil and

water toxicity and reduces soil fertility. Therefore, Tamil
Nadu Organic Farming Policy has recently been released
by the Hon'ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to encourage
organic farming that adopts organic manures free from
any inorganic substance. To encourage organic farming,
725

clusters

will

be

formed

covering

an

area

of

14,500 hectare in 32 districts. To encourage organic
certification, assistance for certification will be provided
for 10,000 hectares. An allocation of Rs.26 crore will
be made.
b) An amount of one crore Rupees will be allocated
to provide financial assistance of one lakh Rupees per
group

towards

the

establishment

of

organic

input

18
production centres for 100 farmers groups interested in
the

production

Panchagavya,

and

sale

of

organic

Jeevamirtham,

inputs

like

Vermicompost,

Amirthakaraisal, Meen Amilam, etc.
c) The silt deposited in tanks and ponds is rich in
nutrients required to improve the soil health. Hence,
last year, the State Government permitted taking tank silt
from waterbodies by farmers for application to agricultural
fields based on which 15 lakh cubic metres of tank silt
was taken benefitting 12,500 farmers. Likewise, during
this year also, government will take special steps to
identify feasible tanks and ponds through the officials of
water resources and rural development departments and
create awareness among farmers to apply tank silt in
their

fields.

Awards

will

be

given

to

District

Collectors who contribute towards completing this
task in a timely manner to benefit more farmers.
d)

Promotion of Organic farming in Nilgiris
General awareness is nowadays prevalent about

production of safe food without polluting air, soil and
water. It is important to live in harmony with nature and
preserve the natural resources for the healthy life of
future generations. A special scheme will be implemented
to massively promote organic farming in Nilgiris District
over a period of five years at an outlay of Rs.50 crore.
Creation of awareness on Organic Farming, reducing the
use

of

Chemical

fertilizers,

introduction

of

Organic

19
cultivation

practices,

providing

guidance

on

the

production of vermicompost, Panchagavya, Dasagavya
etc., extending cultivation assistance, registration for
Organic Certification, creation of markets for organic
produces

will

be

carried

out

in

the

coming

year

at an outlay of five crore Rupees.
e) In the ensuing year, an amount of Rs.20 lakh will
be allocated to provide fifty percent subsidy to organic
farmers for undertaking pesticide residue analysis of their
organic produce, to enable the farmers to ensure the
quality of the produce.
f) Awareness about the importance of Organic
Farming will be created among farmers, rural youth, farm
women and students.
g) To identify potential areas to be brought under
organic farming, baseline survey will be taken up in all
districts except Chennai.
5.

Nammazhvar Award for Best Organic Farmer
In recognition of the great contribution made by

Thiru. Nammazhvar in the field of Organic Farming,
this Government will institute an award in the name
of Nammazhvar to be given to the farmers who practice
and promote organic farming and hand hold fellow
organic

farmers.

The

award

will

consist

of

five lakh Rupees in cash and a citation and will be given
during the Republic Day.

20
6.

Green Cover through Agro Forestry
Trees are a boon to the soil, provide shelter to

pedestrians, serve as a sanctuary for birds, offer shade
and bring about a cool breeze and add to the height of
greenery. Trees cool the soil and promote rainfall while
absorbing carbon dioxide and reducing pollution. Trees
prevent soil erosion during rainfall and provide shelter to
chirping birds, which adds music to the air. In Tamil
Nadu, growing trees on agricultural lands increases the
livelihood

of

farmers

and

serves

as

a

repository.

Therefore, to make quality tree saplings available to the
farmers, under the Agroforestry Scheme, Government
institutions and private bodies will be given financial
assistance to set up new nurseries. Financial Assistance
will be provided to existing nurseries to raise high value
tree saplings and supply them to farmers at full subsidy.
In the coming year, 75 lakh high value tree saplings like
Red

Sanders,

Sandal,

Teak

and

Mahogany

will

be

distributed with an allocated budget of Rs.15 crore
from the Union and State Government Funds.
7.

Additional 20 percent subsidy for Small and
Marginal Farmers of Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribe
An additional subsidy of twenty percent will be

given for high value components such as agricultural
machineries, value addition machineries, solar powered
pump sets, solar driers, cold storages, integrated farming
units, poly green house, shade net etc to small and

21
marginal farmers of Scheduled Caste at an outlay of
Rs.10 crore and small and marginal farmers of Scheduled
Tribes at an outlay of one crore Rupees totalling
Rs.11 crore from State funds.
8.

Digital Agriculture
With the aim of introducing the latest digital

technologies in agriculture and enabling farmers to use
them easily and quickly, cashless transactions were
announced in the last Agriculture Budget to facilitate
farmers in getting the inputs. This was implemented on a
pilot basis in 37 Agricultural Extension Centers. Building
on this success, the programme will be extended to 385
Block Agricultural Extension Centers across 37 districts in
the coming year.
a.

Agricultural e-Service Centres
There

Centers

are

under

currently
the

880

control

Agricultural

of

the

Extension

Department

of

Agriculture in Tamil Nadu. In order to ensure that all
eligible farmers have access to benefits provided by the
Agriculture-Farmers Welfare Department, farmers are
required

to

apply

electronically.

To

facilitate

this,

Agricultural e-Service centers will be implemented in 385
Agricultural Extension Centers, where farmers can apply
for

and

receive

all

services

related

to

agriculture

electronically, under one roof. The Agricultural e-Service
centres will be established at an outlay of two crore

22
Rupees in coordination with Tamil Nadu e-Governance
Agency.
b.

Information Dissemination Group
WhatsApp groups of farmers at block levels will be

formed

so

as

to

enable

instantaneous

sharing

of

information related to technologies, market conditions,
weather forecasts, subsidy schemes, pests and disease
attacks etc. Farmers from all hamlets will be added as
members in this group. The concerned block Assistant
Director

of

Agriculture

and

Assistant

Director

of

Horticulture will act as the administrator.
Further, WhatsApp groups will be formed at the
district and State levels by converging the block level
groups. The state level publicity unit will share district
specific information with the district WhatsApp group,
through SMS, Voice messages, Voice blasting, digital
advertisements etc. This information will be forwarded to
the block-level farmers WhatsApp group and they will
disseminate the information to other farmers in their
hamlets.
c.

GRAINS-One Platform-Multiple Benefits
At present, farmers need to visit several offices and

submit a number of documents in different forms, to avail
benefits

under

agriculture

schemes

related

implemented

departments.

To

by

various

simplify

these

procedures, a new portal called “GRAINS” (Grower

23
Online Registration of Agriculture Input System) will be
introduced in Tamil Nadu in which the basic details like
bank

account,

Aadhar

number

of

landowners

and

cultivators, land details and crop cultivation details will be
collected and digitised. This platform will enable the
farmers to avail various benefits from a single source
(One Stop Solution).
This portal will be designed to enable the farmers to
easily get various Government scheme benefits viz., crop
loan, incentive for paddy and sugarcane, relief assistance
under State Disaster Response Fund and scheme benefits
from 13 Agriculture and Allied departments, which will be
useful not only to farmers but also to Government
departments.
9.

Integrated Farming System
Crop

husbandry

alone

cannot

improve

a farmer's life. Integrated farming /mixed farming system
that include milch cows for year-round benefits, goats for
immediate cash requirement, backyard poultry for special
occasions, fodder crops for animals, fruit trees for
nourishment, tree saplings as an investment, beekeeping
for pollination, vermicomposting for soil health, nutrition
gardens for use in daily meals and fish rearing in farm
ponds are essential for stable and sustainable income. To

Coconut tree is special as it converts the water
imbibed through its roots and gives back in the form of
tender coconuts on its crown. Coconut tree nurtures the
growers like a Mother. It yields abundant fruit throughout
year and protects those who own it and this native tree is
cherished for its magnificence. It yields well even in
drought conditions. While in tender form, coconut tree
provides its refreshing water. Coconut is widely used in
Tamil Nadu cuisine and it is a versatile ingredient that
provides richness and flavour to many dishes. Due to its
resilience and ability to produce high yield with minimal

26
maintenance, coconut remains a preferred crop. Coconut
also gives various by-products like oil and other numerous
beneficial products.

14.

Crop Insurance:
Cultivation is a gamble with nature. Right from the

day of sowing, the farmers are overwhelmed by worries
related to the possibility of their crops getting destroyed
by pests and diseases, withered by drought, blown away
by storms, inundated by rain, and spoilt by mould. Crop
insurance scheme serves as a saving grace to the
farmers.
With the main objective of protecting farmers from
these natural calamities, the Government of Tamil Nadu
has been implementing the

crop insurance

scheme

despite the tight financial situation it presently is in.
In the coming year, this scheme will be continued with

30
Department of Sugar
Sweetness is the epitome of taste. Memorable
events are always called as "Sweet Memories". Sugar is
the most preferred source of Sweetness.
The Government of Tamil Nadu is bestowing special
thrust to Sugar industry. Cane cultivation and Sugar
Industries support the socio-economic development of the
farmers besides providing employment opportunities and
source for increasing their income.
For

sustainable

Sugarcane

production,

the

Government of Tamil Nadu is encouraging Sugarcane
farmers

through

various

welfare

schemes.

Special

Incentive of Rs.195/- per Metric tonne of cane was
extended to 1.21 lakh farmers in 2021-22 sugar season
at an outlay of Rs.214 crore. The special measures taken
by the Government of Tamil Nadu have resulted in a
significant increase of 55,000 hectare of registered
sugarcane area during the 2022-23 sugar season.
To protect the welfare of Sugarcane farmers,
increase the area and production of Sugarcane and to
improve the efficiency of Sugar Mills, the following
programmes will be implemented in the coming year.

17. Special Incentive to Sugarcane farmers:

31
Considering the Welfare of Sugarcane Farmers in
Tamil Nadu, the Government of Tamil Nadu will
allocate Rs.253 crore to provide Special Incentive of
Rs.195/- over and above the Fair and Remunerative
Price (FRP) of Rs.2,821 per MT of cane announced by
the Union Government to eligible farmers during 2022-23
crushing season. This will benefit around 1.50 lakh
sugarcane farmers.
18. Sugarcane Development Programme:
To increase sugarcane production, achieve higher
sugar recovery and to reduce the cost of cultivation,
Breeder seeds, bud chip seedlings of high yielding, high
sugar varieties will be distributed at subsidized cost. The
cane yards in seven Cooperative and Public sector sugar
Mills will be upgraded to cement concrete cane yards.
These programmes will be implemented at an outlay of
Rs.10 crore in the ensuing year.
19. Organic Manure Production from Press Mud:
To meet the demand for organic manure from the
farmers

Department of Horticulture and Plantation Crops

32
Tamil Nadu, from time immemorial, has been
flourishing with abundance of densely grown Horticulture
crops like Coconut, Mango, Pomegranate, Acid lime, Jack
etc. as multi storey cropping.
The verses of Mukkudar Pallu (‘முக்கூைற் பள்ளு’)
depict the ancient wealth as the nuts of the tall grown
coconut trees fall on Arecanut palms, which in turn fall on
mango trees, and subsequently rest on the jack trees,
which in turn bend the banana bunches which finally,
touch and push the pomegranate branch.
“மீது யர்ந்திடும் சதங்கிை நீளர
மிளைந்த பூகஞ்
சுமந்துதன் கொளயக்
குத சமொன்றிச் சுமக்கக் சகொடுக்கும்
சூதந் தன்கே
தூங்கும் பலொவில்
ஓதும் அந்தப் பலொக்கே வொளை
உளுக்க லவசுமந்து
ஒண்குளல ொய்க்கும்
மொது ைங்சகொம்பு வொளைளயத் தொங்கும்
வைளம ஆசூர்
வைகளர நொலை.”
Horticulture department ensures nutrition. Fruits
and vegetables must be grown on par with food grains so
that the demand for necessary minerals, vitamins, fibre,
etc., needed to enhance the immunity and improve
digestion are met by the consumers. Horticultural crops
can aid in not only increasing the income of the farmers
but also in facilitating the digestion process.

33
As announced during the last Agriculture Budget,
special schemes for Horticultural Crop diversification,
intercropping in coconut, precision farming, drip irrigation
on cluster basis, cultivation of fruit crops, tuber crops,
spices, flowers, garlic and implementing schemes to
increase the arrival of vegetables in Uzhavar Sandhais
were implemented.
During this year, Tamil Nadu is marching ahead
towards attaining self-sufficiency in nutrition by producing
large quantities of fruits and vegetables. Likewise, during
the coming year, special schemes will be implemented by
the Horticulture department to increase the production of
Horticultural crops by encouraging farmers to cultivate
more of vegetables and fruits in addition to food crops.
20.

Cultivation of Horticultural Crops on cluster
basis
Exclusive Clusters will be formed for horticultural

crops such as jasmine, curry leaves, chillies and jackfruit
in districts where they are cultivated in a large scale, to
give special focus on production, value addition and
export. The scheme will be implemented by creating an
exclusive brand for the produce generated from the
cluster and link the farmers with the domestic and global
value chains, thus providing higher income to the farmers
and improving their livelihoods.
a.

Mission for Madurai Jasmine

34
The connection between Madurai and jasmine has
been there since the Sangam period. Hence, it is
pertinent to develop a cluster for jasmine centred at
Madurai.
Other than Madurai, Jasmine is also cultivated in
Virudhunagar, Dindigul, Theni and Tenkasi districts in a
total area of about 4,300 Ha. In this integrated cluster,
apart from increasing the production, better marketing
opportunities will also be created. This scheme will be
implemented continuously over a period of five years.
Steps will be taken to produce planting materials needed
for the cluster in Ramanathapuram district and distribute
them in time.
Measures

to

ensure

off-season

production

of

jasmine by giving technical guidance to the existing
jasmine farmers on timely pruning, integrated nutrient
and pest management will be undertaken. In the
ensuing year, this mission will be implemented at
an outlay of seven crore Rupees.
b.

Jack Mission:
Jack fruit being the State fruit of Tamil Nadu is a

renowned fruit. Jack Mission will be implemented in a
span of five years by forming Integrated cluster for
Panruti Jack specific to Cuddalore district where it is
grown in a large extent. Planting materials, inputs,
infrastructure for value addition to create global market

35
opportunities will be provided in the cluster. International
conferences will be held and trainings on production of
value-added products from jack will be given.
In other districts, new suitable Jack varieties will be
introduced,

and

farmers

will

be

encouraged.

Jack

cultivation will be taken up in 2,500 Ha in five years. This
scheme will be implemented in 21 districts like Ariyalur,
Cuddalore, Dindigul, Kanyakumari, Pudukkottai, Salem,
Tenkasi, Theni etc.,
To give impetus to research on development of new
varieties, high yielding technologies and value addition in
jack, the Vegetable Research Station in Palur will be
strengthened and an amount of three crore Rupees will
be allocated for this Mission.
c.

Chilli Zone:
In Tamil Nadu, chillies is grown in an area of 35,200

hectare in Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Sivagangai
and Thoothukudi districts, which will be converged to
form a Chilli Zone and action will be taken to increase the
cultivation to 40,000 hectare in a period of five years.
Latest technologies will be disseminated to increase the
productivity. Infrastructure will be created for storing and
marketing of produce at the appropriate time. Farm ponds
will be created in water scarce areas and cultivation will
be done through installation of micro irrigation.

36
In the ensuing year, it is planned to remove the
Prosopis trees, in an area of 1,000 Ha in convergence
with Rural Development and Agricultural Engineering
Departments and bring the area under chilli cultivation.
Further, to cultivate chillies in an area of 1,000
hectare, in addition to giving seeds, seedlings and other
inputs to farmers, processing units, value addition units
and solar driers will also be established to produce Chilli
powder, Chilli paste, Chilli flakes and Chilli oil and
tarpaulins will also be given to farmers to process chillies
in a hygienic manner. This scheme will be implemented
at an outlay of six crore Rupees in the ensuing year.
d.

Curry Leaf Cluster:
Curry leaf, which adds flavour and aroma to our

dishes, is largely grown in Coimbatore district in Tamil
Nadu. Technical advice will be given to farmers to adopt
appropriate plant protection measures, restrict the usage
of pesticides, use organic farming techniques for the
cultivation of Curry Leaves. The cluster scheme will be
implemented in an area of 1,500 hectare over a period of
five years. In the ensuing year, cultivation of Sengambu
variety of curry leaf will be encouraged in an area of 100
hectare by providing quality planting materials and drip
irrigation systems. Trainings on production of value added
products in Curry leaves such as dry curry leaf, curry leaf
powder and paste will be given.

37
Also, farm machineries, solar drying unit and value
addition machinery will be distributed. Residue analysis of
curry leaf samples will be carried out to meet the export
standards. An allocation of Rs.2.50 crore will be made
for implementation of this scheme in the coming year.
21.

Moringa Mission
Considering the multiple health benefits of Moringa,

the Government of Tamil Nadu has announced "Special
Export Zone for Moringa" covering the districts of
Theni, Dindigul, Karur, Thoothukudi, Tirupur, Ariyalur and
Madurai in the first Agriculture Budget. A Special Export
Facilitation Centre is functioning at Madurai.
In the coming year, Moringa cultivation will be
promoted in 1,000 ha besides creating processing and
value addition facilities. Further, to increase the export
opportunities

in

Moringa,

training

on

techniques,

value

addition,

certification

cultivation
and

export

standards will be imparted to farmers, exporters through
this centre in coordination with the Agricultural and
Processed Food Products Export Development Authority
(APEDA).

For

this

Mission,

an

allocation

of

Rs.11 crore will be made in the coming year.

22.

Stabilizing the supply of tomatoes and onions
Tomato and onion have become indispensable in the

cuisine of Tamil Nadu. These daily needs are produced in

38
excess in seasons causing glut and the farmers are left
with no other option than to leave the produce in the field
without harvesting. In off- seasons, they become so
expensive that common people could not afford to buy.
Appropriate scheme will be implemented with an aim to
stabilise the supply of onion and tomato round the year.
Assistance will be extended for distribution of Onion
seeder, storage godowns, harvesting machines and Onion
de-topper at an outlay of Rs.29 crore in the districts of
Perambalur,

Namakkal,

Salem,

Thoothukudi,

Trichy,

Dindigul and Tiruppur to facilitate continuous supply of
onion.
Similarly, to increase the productivity of tomato,
interventions like installation of drip irrigation, staking,
cultivation of high yielding varieties and mulching will be
promoted.

This

scheme

will

be

implemented

in

Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Salem, Dindigul, Theni, Tiruppur
and Coimbatore districts at an outlay of Rs.19 crore.
23.

Production of Cole crops like Chow-Chow,
Peas, Beans etc.,
Cole crops /hilly vegetables like Chow-Chow, Peas,

Beans are gaining popularity among the consumers.
Hence, focus will be given for the cultivation of these
crops by providing seeds, inputs and staking materials as
back-ended subsidy. This scheme will be implemented in
an area of 1,000 hectare at an outlay of Rs.2.50 crore.

39
24.

Area expansion in special Horticulture crops
The demand for horticultural crops having high

value and high marketability such as dragon fruit,
avocado, date palm, Lychee, Mangosteen, Fig and Olive is
increasing. Farmers are keen to take up cultivation of
these crops which are mostly imported in Tamil Nadu.
Cultivation of these crops will be promoted to expand in
suitable places covering an area of 1,000 ha during the
ensuing year. Subsidy will be provided for cultivation of
these crops along with training on cultivation practices.
For this, two crore Rupees will be provided from the
Union and State Government fund.
25.

Promotion of Micro irrigation
Thiruvalluvar in one of his couplets, notes that

“When there is no water, world ceases to exist”. No World
can survive without water. The trend of spending money
like water has now been changed to that level of spending
water

as

money.

Each

drop

is

so

precious

and

conservation of each drop is an investment.
In

Firkas

where

underground

water

is

drawn

completely and the water table is fast depleting, the area
under cultivation is decreasing. Agriculture is affected due
to shortage of water. Hence, steps will be taken to adopt
micro irrigation techniques for effectively utilising the
groundwater to bring more area under cultivation. This
scheme will be implemented in those areas where micro
irrigation is effective. During the coming year, a total sum

40
of Rs.744 crore will be allocated for implementation of
Micro Irrigation Scheme of which sixty percent i.e.,
Rs.450 crore will be spent to cover 53,400 hectare
under micro irrigation in these firkas.
Further, this Government will insist the Union
Government to relax the ceiling of five hectare to avail
subsidy for micro irrigation and increase it to 10 ha and to
reduce the minimum period from seven years to five
years to re-avail subsidy for micro irrigation in the same
field.
26.

Distribution
families

of

fruit

saplings

to

10

Lakh

Fruits are rich in fibre, reduce blood pressure,
control heart diseases, prevent paralytic attack, rectify
digestion problem and sharpen the eyesight. A balanced
diet will be with white, green, brown, red and yellow
coloured food in appropriate ratio.

Fruits play a major

role in providing such food.
Even though Tamil Nadu is self-sufficient in food
grain production, fruit production is essential to attain
nutritional security. Nature offers us seasonal fruits.
Nature showers its benevolence by providing refreshing
fruits during summer and warm fruits in winter.
Hence, in the coming year, kits containing perennial
fruit seedlings such as Mango, Guava, Jack, Amla, Acid
lime, custard apple will be distributed to 10 lakh
households at an outlay of Rs.15 crore.

41
27. Promotion of protected cultivation methods
Farmers can enhance their income throughout the
year in cultivation of high value vegetables and flowers in
protected cultivation structures like poly houses and
shade net houses. To provide assistance for establishing
these

structures,

a

sum

of

Rs.22

crore

will

be

allocated from Union and State Government funds in the
coming year by giving priority to the districts Dindigul,
Dharmapuri, Ranipet, Salem, Sivagangai, Theni, Erode,
Thirupatthur,

Tirupur,

Tiruchirappalli,

Tirunelveli

and

Madurai.
28. Beautification of Parks
Every year, more than 50,000 tourists visit the
Government Botanical Gardens, Yercaud. To increase the
number of visitors, Topiary will be created. Hedge lined
pathway, plant backgrounds and live sculptures will be
created in this Garden with the financial outlay of five
crore Rupees.
Annually, two lakh people visit the Horticultural
Park, Madhavaram in Chennai. To add beauty to this park
and attract visitors, Musical Dancing Fountain and park
expansion will be carried out with the financial outlay
of five crore Rupees.
29. Overseas training for the farmers
The productivity is very high in some countries
through adoption of high yielding technologies. Farmers of

42
our

State

will

get

motivated

to

do

so

as

these

technologies make them ponder over the experiences
from such countries. Keeping high productivity in their
minds,

they

will

be

eager

to

experiment

these

technologies in their fields as seeing is believing and
doing is learning. Hence, it is programmed to take
150 farmers for this overseas tour to countries like Isreal,
Netherland, Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Philippines etc.,
for which a sum of three crore Rupees will be
allocated from the Union and State Government funds.
30.Traditional Vegetables:
Tamil Nadu owns lot of traditional tasty vegetables.
As done during this year, the traditional vegetable seeds
will be collected during the coming year also to set up the
gene bank to popularise them. District level seed festivals
and State level seminar will be conducted. Cash award
will be conferred to the farmers who have revived
maximum traditional vegetables seeds. These traditional
vegetable seeds will be further multiplied at State
Horticulture Farms and distributed to farmers and public

at an outlay of Rs. 1.50 Crore in the coming year.
31.

Integrated Micro Irrigation system in Lower
Bhavani:
Bhavani river originates from Nilgiris of Western

Ghats. We can see green fields in riverbed areas.

43
Integrated Micro irrigation infrastructure system will be
installed on pilot basis, in 960 hectares of cultivable lands
of Lower Bhavani Project in Erode District on cluster basis.
This project aims to encourage the farmers to cultivate
crops throughout the year by judiciously using the water
and get more income. By this method, irrigation system
will be provided in the Ayacut area of Thottampalayam,
Akkarai Negamam, Karithottampalayam, Poosaripalayam
etc., for cultivation of Horticulture Crops like vegetables,
turmeric, banana, etc., This scheme will be implemented
in a period of two years at an approximate outlay of
Rs.50 crore.
32.

Area Expansion of Cashew:
As the market potential for cashew is increasing not

only in

domestic

markets but

also

in

international

markets, in the ensuing year, action will be taken to
increase the cashew cultivation with additional area of
550 hectare and the old, low yielding cashew tress will be
removed and the high yielding varieties will be replanted
and renewed in 500 hectares. Special emphasis will be
given to Panruti and adjoining areas.
33.

Banana cluster development scheme in Theni
district:
To create a unique identity for banana in Theni

district which stands first in banana productivity in
Tamil Nadu and make them to reach the global market,
a specific cluster development scheme in cost of

44
Rs.130 crore is to be implemented in public-private
partnership.
34.

Farm tourism for School Students:
With

an

aim

to

inculcate

the

importance

of

agriculture among school students by directly witnessing
the fields, orchards, plantations, irrigation wells, fruit
trees, etc., Farm tourism is proposed to be promoted in
association
students

with

who

see

Education
the

Department

fields,

orchards,

for

school

plantations,

irrigation wells, fruit trees, etc., only in their books and in
the media.
This will be a great exposure as freedom from the
clutches of concrete jungle, enjoyable play area in seeing
the emerald green fields and to respect the significance of
farmers’ sweat and the value of food. It will be a practical
training to get answers for the questions in their
curriculum.
This type of farm tourism will help those urban
stricken students to learn the way of eco-friendly living in
harmony with Nature. This will be an eye opener for the
students who assume that rice and grams are produced in
factories.

This

scheme

will

be

implemented

at

an

allocation of one crore Rupees.
35.

Palmyra Development Mission:
In the past two years of Palmyra Development

Mission implementation, 20 lakh palmyra seed nuts, one

45
lakh

palmyra

saplings

have

been

distributed.

510 machineries have been distributed to 124 Palmyra
value addition centers, 1,000 Palm tree climbers have
been distributed and efforts have been taken to give a
cash award of one lakh rupees to the best palm tree
climbing machine inventors.
a. To encourage Palmyra cultivation, ten lakh Palmyra
seed nuts will be provided to farmers and NGOs to
plant in public places like riverbanks next year.
Value

addition

in

Palmyra

products

will

be

encouraged to improve the livelihood of farmers. In
order to facilitate the value addition in Palmyra,
support for value addition sheds, equipment and
safe tree climber will be given. Through the Tamil
Nadu

Palmyra

Products

Development

Board,

training for palm jaggery production, palm candy
and

other

palm-based

products

in

a

hygienic

manner will be provided. Women will be trained in
the production of palm leaf products. This scheme
will be implemented at an outlay of two crore
Rupees.

b.

Establishment of Palmyra Research Station:
In Killikulam Agricultural College, the creation of

short duration Palmyra varieties and the research related
to the postharvest technology are being carried out. To
give more importance to this, a separate research station

46
for Palmyra will be established at Killikulam Agricultural
College

in

Thoothukudi

district

at

the

cost

of

Rs.15 crore with objectives of creation of new dwarf
Palmyra varieties and to make available the requirements
for

plantation,

the

instructions

for

the

plantation,

nutrition, water, insects and disease management will be
regulated, the quality checking lab will be established for
inspecting

the

quality of the

palmyra value

added

products such as Neera, Palmyra jaggery, palm candy,
post-harvest technology and value addition technology
will be created.
Department of Agricultural Engineering
Men differ from animals not in managing time but
by creating time. While lion and tiger hunted with claws
and sharp teeth, man hunted with tools and hence he
could save his time. Tools help to increase his speed.
Speed

and

haste

are

quite

different.

Scientific

technologies are meant to accelerate our work speed.
Speed comes, when the body and mind work in tandem.
Haste happens when body does not cooperate with the
pace of the mind.

36. Agricultural Mechanization:
Agricultural machineries help to create time. The
harvesting of a field which normally need hundreds of
men can be completed by a single machine within a few

47
hours. The dearth of farm labourers is increasing in
villages of Tamil Nadu. Due to decentralized education,
fast spreading urbanization, people become educated,
graduated and get placements in various jobs. Hence,
the shortage of manpower is increasing on par with
developed countries. Farm mechanization is essential for
carrying out agricultural operations.
Labour is saved and time is generated because of
the

availability

agricultural

of

machinery

operations

like

to

carry

out

ploughing,

various
sowing,

transplanting, weeding, fruit plucking, harvesting, value
addition, digging, onion detopping, Oil extraction etc.,
The surplus time thus created is being used for other
operations. This Government is taking various steps to
distribute farm machinery at subsidy by giving priority to
small and marginal farmers.
In the coming year, a sum of Rs. 125 crore will
be allocated from the Union and State Government
funds for the components like agricultural machinery
value

addition

machinery,

machinery

for

sugarcane

cultivation and village based Custom Hiring Centres
besides digitalizing the selection of beneficiaries.
37. Skill Development training for Rural youth:
Skills are essential for effective living. Use of
machinery in rural areas alone is not quite sufficient.
Skilled

manpower

is

needed

for

operation

and

48
maintenance of farm machinery. Hence, skilled drivers
are very much needed to operate agricultural machinery.
Skill development training will be imparted to 500 rural
youth for Operation, maintenance and handling of tractors
and

harvesters

at

a

cost

of one

crore Rupees

in six workshops functioning at Vellore, Coimbatore,
Trichy, Madurai, Tiruvarur and Tirunelveli.
Due to the use of agricultural machinery in the
fields and in undulated terrains, they often face break
down causing hardships in ploughing. Hence, instead of
bringing this machinery to the urban areas for repairing,
training to rural youth is the need of the hour to repair in
the village itself. To generate self-employment for rural
youth, short-term training in repairs and maintenance of
agricultural machinery will be provided to 200 rural youth
in

six

State

owned

Government

Tractor

workshops

at a cost of Rs.50 lakh.
38. Rain water Harvesting Structures:
In 'Purananooru', one poem written by Kapilar
explains about the knowledge of ancient Tamils on
designing the water reservoirs.

அளறயும் சபொளறயும் மணந்த தளலய,
எண் நொள் திங்கள் அளனய சகொடுங் களரத்
சதண்ணீர்ச் சிறு குைம் கீள்வது மொலதொ
கூர் லவல் குளவஇய சமொய்ம்பின்
லதர் வண் பொரி தண் பறம்பு நொலை.

49
Sediments are washed away from the catchment
areas of the reservoirs during the rainy season and
deposited in the reservoirs, every year, thereby reducing
the capacity of the reservoirs. In selected reservoirs,
the works like Soil conservation, Watershed management,
Drainage line treatment, Silt detention structures, Rain
water harvesting structures like check dams etc., will be
taken up under Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement
Project with World Bank assistance in a period of four
years period from 2023-2024. This project will be
implemented in the catchment areas of Vaigai Dam in
Theni District and Mettur Dam in Salem District at an
estimated cost of six crore Rupees.
39.

Uploading the details of private machinery and
mechanics in e-Vaadagai App:

In order to facilitate the farmers to carry out ploughing
operation without any hindrance, block wise, district wise
details of private owners of Tractors and mechanics of
agricultural machinery as well as pump sets will be
uploaded in the e-Vaadagai App with their name, address
and mobile number and linked with Uzhavan App.

40. Ensuring Irrigation to the tail end:
To ensure irrigation water till tail end, desilting of
“C” and “D” channels will be executed in the second phase
in Cauvery and Vennar Basins of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur,

50
Nagapattinam, Mayiladuthurai and Cuddalore districts
during the next year as done in the last year, benefitting
an area of 1.32 lakh acres for a length of 1,146
Kilometres at an allocation of five crore Rupees.
41.

Strengthening the activities of Agricultural
Engineering Department at Block level:
Considering

the

huge

demand

for

agricultural

machinery and the responsibility of Government to serve
up to remote hamlets and to facilitate the farmers to
carry

out

the

agricultural

operations

without

any

hindrance at block level, Tractors, Rotavators, Cultivators,
Sugarcane Harvesters, Paddy combine harvesters will be
procured at a total cost of Rs.25 crore and will be hired
out to the needy farmers at nominal hire charges through
e-vadagai mobile app.
Also,

the

Agricultural

Engineering

Department,

presently functioning at the Revenue Divisional Level, will
be restructured so as to extend its services at the block
level Integrated Agriculture Extension Centre (IAEC)s.
42.

“One Village Two Power Tillers”
Considering the decrease in the land holdings of

farmers in Tamil Nadu and the necessity to promote the
use of small type of agricultural machinery, 5,000 Power
Tillers will be distributed 2,504 villages at the rate of
two Power Tillers per village under the Tamil Nadu
Government’s Vision scheme of “Kalaignarin All Village

51
Integrated Agriculture Development Programme” with a
subsidy of Rs.43 crore in the coming year.
Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business
The harvested crop produce will be of no use, if it is
being dried in the threshing floor or stacked in the drying
yard. The farm produce fetches value only when it
reaches the consumer. The Department of Agricultural
Marketing - Agri Business is extending its handholding
support to ensure this task.
43. Additional infrastructure in Regulated Markets:
Facilities

like

transaction

sheds,

drying

yards,

storage godowns will be provided in the Regulated
Markets

of

Gingee,

Thiruvennainallur

in

Villupuram

District, Papanasam in Thanjavur district Naidumangalam,
Athamangalam Pudhur in Tiruvannamalai District and
Veppur in Cuddalore District at an outlay Rs.22 crore
with Union and State Government funds.
Further, new infrastructure will be created in the
Regulated Markets viz., Sankagiri, Kadayampatti in Salem
District, Rasipuram, Namakkal in Namakkal District which
are

functioning in rented buildings besides creation of

additional storage godowns
viz.,

in the Regulated Markets

Sivagiri, Punjai kalamangalam, Elumathur in Erode

District,

Malaiyadi

palayam,

Anaimalai in Coimbatore District

Negamam,

Karamadai,

at an estimated cost

of Rs.36 crore from Market Committee funds.

Reconstruction
of
Regulated Markets:

Storage

godowns

in

In 22 Regulated Markets functioning in the districts
of Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Vellore, Tirupattur, Erode,
Tiruchirapalli,

Karur,

Thanjavur,

Tirunelveli,

Thoothukudi,

Sivagangai,

Tiruvarur

and

Tenkasi,
Ariyalur,

27 storage godowns will be reconstructed with the total
capacity of 34,000 MT at a total cost of Rs.54 crore
with NABARD assistance.
45. Renovation of existing Regulated Markets:
To facilitate farmers to realize remunerative price to
their produce, the Regulated Markets in 100 places with
heavy arrival, will be renovated at an estimate cost of
Rs.50 crore with market committee funds.
46. Securing Geographical Indication tag:
Each soil is unique in nature. The taste of the
produce varies from place to place depending upon the
climate, rainfall, wind and sunshine. There are number of
such agricultural commodities which are unique in Tamil
Nadu. The production of such produce differs from district
to district. The value of such unique commodities would
increase, if we secure Geographical Indication tags and
popularise in the global market. Last year, steps have
been taken to get Geographical Indication (GI) tag for ten
products including Sholavanthan Betel vine and Panruti
Jack fruit.

53
Likewise,

it

is

proposed

to

get

Geographical

Indication (GI) for another ten products viz., Krishnagiri
Arasampatti

Coconut,

Krishnagiri

Panneer

Rose,

Thanjavur Peravoorani Coconut, Mulanoor Kuttai Moringa,
Sattur

Cucumber,

Thanjavur

Veeramangudi

Jaggery

(Achu vellam), Thoothukudi Vilathikulam Chilli, Cuddalore
Kotimulai Brinjal, Madurai Sengarumbu and Sivagangai
Karuppukavuni rice at an outlay of Rs.30 lakh in the
ensuing year.
47. Renovation of Uzhavar Sandhais:
Uzhavar Sandhais act as platforms for enabling the
farmers to sell their produce. Farm fresh vegetables if
purchased at less price will delight the consumers and
elate the farmers. In the last two years, 100 Uzhavar
Sandhais

were

renovated

with

better

infrastructure.

Hence, the number of farmers and consumers who visit
the Uzhavar Sandhais has increased significantly.
On an average, 8,000 farmers and three lakh
consumers visit Uzhavar Sandhais daily. It is proposed to
renovate 25 Uzhavar Sandhais in the districts of Dindigul,
Kallakurichi,

Namakkal,

Pudukkottai,

Tiruppur,

Tiruvannamalai with the basic amenities such as drinking
water, toilet, renovation of shops, repair of floors, repair
of

roofs,

footpath

facilities

etc.,

at

a

cost

of

nine crore Rupees. Further, steps will be taken to
secure Food Safety and Standards Authority of India

54
(FSSAI) Certificate for 50 Uzhavar Sandhais in the
ensuing year at an outlay of Rs.25 lakh.
48. Traditional Canteens:
The farmers bring their vegetables and greens to
Uzhavar Sandhais in the early morning. They become
exhausted in selling vegetables and fruits till noon. Hence,
to quench their thirst and meet their food demand,
25 traditional canteens will be established as first phase
with private participation for providing the traditional
cuisine of Tamil Nadu viz., nutritious Millet porridge,
snacks, herbal soups to the consumers to sensitize them
on traditional foods.
49.

Expansion of electronic National Agriculture
Markets – (e NAM):
Out of 284 Regulated Markets in Tamil Nadu,

127 Regulated Markets have been integrated under
electronic National Agriculture Markets (e-NAM) portal
and are functioning well. In view of participation of more
traders in the indirect auction system after assessing the
quality of the produce, e-NAM Markets has ensured
remunerative price to farmers. Till date, six lakh farmers
have transacted 10 lakh metric tonnes of produce worth
Rs.1,700 crore through this platform. In the ensuing year,
another 30 Regulated markets will be integrated under
eNAM portal at an outlay of nine crore Rupees.
50.

Necessary steps will be taken to help the farmers
who grow Gloriosa predominantly in the districts of
Dindigul, Tiruppur, Erode, Tiruchirapalli, Karur, Ariyalur,
Perambalur, Nagapattinam, Salem for trading seeds of
Sengandal Flower (Gloriosa) in the Regulated Markets.
51. Training for Modern Packaging and Agri Export:
To enable the Farmers Producers Organizations to
add value to the produces and market them, special
training has been imparted to 154 Farmer Producer
Organizations on packaging through Indian Institute of
Packaging in Perungudi, Chennai. This training will be
further expanded to 164 Farmer Producer Companies at
an estimated cost of Rs.15 Lakh. Further, to facilitate
additional

income

and

increase

the

market

avenue

through export, 10 seminars on export will be conducted
at an outlay of Rs.50 lakh.
52. e- Negotiable Warehouse receipt:
To facilitate the farmers and traders to avail pledge
loan from Nationalized Banks to the maximum of eighty
percent of value of their produce stored in the godowns,
150 storage godowns in Regulated Markets in Tamil Nadu
will be strengthened and accredited with Warehousing
Development

and

projects, implementing schemes, to sort out various field
issues arise from time to time. This fund will be utilized

58
with the concurrence of Finance Committee of the
University.
55.

Strengthening Insect Museum:
Insects account for the largest group of living

organisms in the world.

We humans, are encroaching

upon the world of insects. It is the insects that give us
scintillating silks, wax and lac. Insects are the ones that
help in cross pollination and creation of hybrid varieties of
crops; The insects also sweeten man’s taste buds with
honey.

It is impossible to imagine a world without

insects. It will be simply empty.

It will be like a world

without the flutter of butterfly, the humming of the bees,
the buzzing of the beetles. It would be akin to ocean sans
waves, coconut palm without bunches, a headless body, a
leafless tree, a nation deficit in art forms, a fruit without
flesh and a poem without metre.
A museum has been created in Coimbatore campus
at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, where various types
of insects have been collected. It is imperative to
understand the role of insects that cause health hazards,
so as to contain them. For the benefit of farmers,
students, researchers and public to identify and classify
insects, it becomes important to digitize the museum for
which three crore Rupees will be allocated for the
upgradation,
infrastructure.

Strengthening of Botanical Garden
The Botanical Garden of Tamil Nadu Agricultural

University is one of the popular parks in Coimbatore.
Mughal Garden, Japanese Garden, Rockery, Topiary,
Branching palms are some of the appealing aspects of this
Botanical Garden. This brings solace for many; It is an
invitation for happiness; a breeze of lullaby that helps to
refresh the minds that feels bored. This Botanical Garden
helps the students to learn about flowers and ornamental
plants. We can find the research scholars spending hours
at the Botanical Gardens to collect insects and to learn
about plants. The prime objectives of this garden are to
preserve the rare plants and to execute research in flower
crops scientifically. This botanical garden is quite old.
To protect and improve the endangered plants, to
establish

different

types

of

parks,

to

impart

entrepreneurial training, five crore Rupees will be
allocated to strengthen botanical garden in the ensuing
year.
57.

Nano Technology in Agriculture:
Nanotechnology is known to bring new revolution in

agriculture. Application of nanotechnology is increased in
the

field

of

Co-operation, Food and Consumer Protection

a)

Cooperative Crop loan:
In the year 2022-23, a total of 16.43 lakh farmers

have been provided with crop loan of Rs.12,648 crore by
cooperative department so far. This is an increase of
89

percent

over

the

average

of

last

10

years.

During 2023-24, Cooperative crop loan to the tune of
Rs.14,000 crore will be given to the farmers. Likewise,
interest-free cooperative loan of Rs.1,500 crore will
be given to the farmers for goat rearing, dairying, poultry
and Fisheries activities.
b)

Direct procurement of paddy:
During

2022-23

Kharif

Marketing

Season,

27.23 lakh metric tonnes of paddy has been procured
from 3.73 lakh farmers for which Rs.5,778 crore has been
disbursed so far. Likewise, for the procurement of paddy
during next year, an allocation of Rs.500 crore has
been made to provide incentive at the rate Rs.100 and
Rs.75 per quintal respectively for fine and bold varieties.
c)

Agricultural Machinery in Primary Agricultural
Co-operative Credit Societies
To ensure availability of agricultural machinery in

every village, agricultural machinery will be purchased
through Primary Agricultural Co-operative Credit Societies
(PACCSs) and hired out through e-Vaadagai App as per
the needs of farmers. Rs.500 crore will be allocated

63
with

NABARD

assistance

for

the

purchase

of

the

machinery.
62)

Water Resources Department:
There are references to establishment of water

bodies in Tamil literature. Rains do not fall at our wish
and will. We, the Tamils are the ones who have learnt to
conserve water during monsoons and use it judiciously
later. Our fore fathers built dams across the rivers.
The historic Kallanai is still an engineering marvel and
stands tall in water resources management. There is
mention in literature that during rains youth stood guard
on the banks of lakes and ponds. Water Resources
Department plays a significant role in reducing the
concern of farmers about their crops by facilitating flow of
water into their fields.
Many
rehabilitation,

projects

like

dam

repairs,

canal

restoration,

creation

of

tank

rainwater

harvesting structure are being implemented through the
department with farmers participation. In the ensuing
year, desiltation will be carried out in rivers, canals and
drainage channels in Cauvery delta command area
at an estimated cost of Rs.90 crore.
63)

Animal Husbandry:
Cattle act as an insurance to the farmers when the

monsoon fails. Whenever crop fails, cattle help the
farmers tide over the deficit. The grazing goats, milch
cows in sheds, bulls on plough and poultry birds in a farm

64
contribute to the scent that is characteristic of a farm.
Even the animal waste is helpful in improving the Soil
fertility and texture.
The

decrease

in grazing lands combined with

shrinkage of pasture lands due to increasing population,
growing demand for nutritive fodder for cross bred cows,
it is essential to produce such nutritive fodder crops in
large quantities. To facilitate this, a total of 60 officials
from Agriculture and Animal husbandry departments will
be trained on latest technologies in fodder production,
conservation methods, grazing, farm mechanization etc.,
at a cost of Rs.10 lakh.
Additionally,

Rs.60

lakh

will

be

allocated

for

encouraging intercropping with fodder crops to increase
fodder production.
64)

Fisheries:
To conserve and replenish native fish species from

extinction, 40 lakh fingerlings of native fish species such
as Selkendai, Calbasu, Indian major carp etc., will be
ranched in the rivers of Cauvery, Bhavani, Thamiraparani
and their tributaries. This will be taken up at a total cost
of Rs.1.2 crore. This will also increase the inland fish
production and increase the revenue of inland fishers
dependent on rivers for their livelihood.

65
65)

Rural Development:
Agricultural development and rural development go

hand in hand and are interdependent. The role of rural
development sector is very important in employment
generation, natural resource development and improving
women's livelihood.

difficulties while felling and transporting mature
high value trees from farmers’ fields. To address

69
this, the State Government will take necessary
steps to simplify the procedure for cutting and
transportation of these high value tree crops grown
in agricultural lands under agroforestry scheme and
help them realise their returns.

Agriculture- Farmers Welfare department and Agriculture
related departments like Animal Husbandry, Fisheries,

and Medium Enterprises Department (Annexure-1).
Hon'ble Speaker,
Agriculture is the mother of all other professions.
Kahlil Gibran observed that the farmer sows the seeds as
though his beloved benefitting will consume the fruits that
it bears. World literature has given farmers a noble place.
Gibran rightly pointed out that the difference between the
rich and the poor is a day's hunger and an hour's thirst.
The legendary poet Thiruvalluvar crowned the farmers
with the statement that “it is those who live to plough and
eat, that live”. Even Shakespeare in his play, Macbeth,
has mentioned about a farmer who had stocked up his
farm’s produce with the hope of getting a better price.
The lives of farmers have often been ridden with pain
caused by the natural calamities.
The Tamil Nadu government has ensconced the
farmers, within its secure arms by providing necessary
infrastructure for agriculture, compensation for losses and
thus ensures to bring a smile to the farmers’ faces.
As stated by the poet Avoor Moolangizhar in Purananooru

72
‘ஒரு பிடி படியுஞ் சீறிைம்
எழு களிறு புரக்கும் நொடு கிைலவொலய!’
That the farmers have in them, the ability to raise
crops that yield as much paddy as would suffice to feed
seven elephants, from the little space in which just one
elephant

rests.

The

crop

productivity

needs

to

be

enhanced such that it receives world-wide recognition.
This Agriculture Budget has been prepared on the basis
that Tamil Nadu should be the front runner to the whole
country in terms of crop productivity.
Once again, I would like to express my gratitude to
the honourable Chief Minister for giving me this great
opportunity for the successive third time.
Agriculture does not work in isolation. A complete
and balanced meal cannot be provided by just harvesting
paddy.

It

needs

science

in

storing

technologies,

technology for grinding techniques, support of industries
to

boil

the

paddy,

horticulture

to

offer

the

many

vegetables that go into a meal, the hill crops to lend their
aromatic spices, the MSME to provide salt to add flavour
and Animal Husbandry for value addition in the form of
ghee, curds and buttermilk. If these many departments
are needed for mere preparation of a complete meal, then
it is left to our wild imagination as to how many more
departments need to get integrated with agriculture to
increase its productivity.

73
Tamil Nadu has been gradually preparing such an
integrated agricultural development plan for two years.
The Agriculture-Farmer Welfare Department has been
toiling to make stepping stones of the several hurdles,
embrace the farmers thoughts and ideas and offer intent
listening to their grievances. This Agriculture Budget has
thus been prepared in accordance with the financial
resources to fulfil the requirement of the farmers to the
best possible extent.
In this Agriculture Budget, emphasis is laid on large
scale Agriculture Mechanization in view of the labour
shortage in agriculture. Mechanisation reduces the cost of
cultivation by half. Blue collar jobs will be made available
in this sector. Skills of the local youth will dramatically
improve. The two major labour-intensive phases in crop
production, Planting and harvesting, can be done quickly
without having to engage draught animals. This will
increase the income of the farmers apart from reducing
the loss of produce during harvest.
Poet Kambar in his book ‘Er Ezhupathu’ states that
farmers play a vital role in feeding the world, and their
efforts are essential for the world to thrive.
‘உழுங்குலத்திற் பிறந்தொலர உலகுய்யப் பிறந்தொலர.’
And our ancient poets assert that the farmers save
the lives of people by providing food.

74
‘‘உண்டி சகொடுத்லதொர் உயிர் சகொடுத்லதொலர;‘
Thus, various schemes have been announced in this
Agriculture budget for the upliftment of the farmers who
are engaged in the most honourable service of feeding
the people.
The awards that have so far been given to achievers
in paddy production, has now been extended to producers
of other crops too as the Tamil Nadu Government is
proactive in popularizing Millets. Awards in the name of
Nammazhvar will be presented by the Hon’ble Chief
Minister in Republic Day celebration. Replenishment of
water bodies, infrastructure development in hamlets and
marketing of agricultural produce will be the strategies to
increase farmers' income. We have consolidated all these
efforts into this single document - Agriculture Budget.
Agriculture can flourish only if all the schemes are
implemented in an integrated manner.
As I requested in the first Agriculture Budget, I
implore the kindness of the honourable members of this
assembly to apportion funds from their Constituency
Development Fund whenever the need emanates so as to
bridge any gaps that may arise beyond the scope of this
Budget, to take the sector forward to reach the zenith.
During our consultative meetings, numerous suggestions
were received from farmers. Although we desire to
include all their recommendations, we have drafted this

75
Agriculture Budget within the ambit of the financial
restrictions imposed upon us.
In this Agriculture Budget, I have emphasized that
the agriculture sector is not only thriving, but is gaining
momentum

by

the

day

with

the

steady

rise

in

productivity. The farmers braved all the impediments,
nature’s

fury

and

have

contributed

to

the

rise

in

agricultural productivity. The good governance over the
last two years have brought copious rains, leaving all
water bodies overflowing. Some of them are remaining
full

rendering

it

difficult

for

the

Water

Resources

Department to undertake desilting activities.
Agricultural growth cannot be achieved when only
the

farmers

work

towards

it.

New

and

innovative

technologies, new crop varieties must be provided to
farmers

continuously.

Agricultural

universities

and

colleges should strive towards developing new high
yielding varieties. Department officials should get to the
grassroots with the intention to take up better extension
activities than last year. Farmers should be become
enthusiastic about winning the first prize for highest yield
in the State.
Therefore, it is evident that agriculture is flourishing
with the support of industries, micro, small and medium
industries,

information

technology,

energy,

rural

development, cooperative sector, water resources, animal
husbandry, fisheries and sericulture departments. Instead

76
of complacent that we have attained self-sufficiency, we
should strive further together with greater conviction so
that the farmers of Tamil Nadu can cultivate various crops
and attain maximum prosperity.
I believe that this Agriculture Budget will act as a
bridge to further improve the initiatives in the years to
come.
As the two Agriculture Budgets of Tamil Nadu were
well presented to the Assembly in the last two years, the
Third Agricultural Budget too has been prepared with
sincere

efforts

for

which

I

would

like

to

extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Secretary,
Dr. V. Irai Anbu, IAS, Additional Chief Secretary, Finance,
Thiru. N.Muruganantham, IAS, and Agricultural Production
Commissioner

and

The farmers should stand firm in their moral
duty and do farming, if it is to rain without fail.
The language will prosper, if they undertake
Green Revolution to eradicate hunger. The literary
works will flourish. The country will gain good
things. Knowledge and skills will progress. There
comes a balance of “Everything for All” without
takers and givers. Good morals will steer the
world. Kavichakaravarthy Kambar in his book
“Yer Ezhupathu” praised that the world will

prosper and the people will gain good health &
well being, only because of the farmers doing
Agriculture.
Agriculture is the noblest occupation of
feeding the people of the world, though there
have been many professions in the world.
Agriculture plays a major role in the sustainable
development of the country. Though Agriculture
remains the primary occupation and livelihood for
majority of the people, it also serves as a
backbone for the development of other industries,
rural employment, domestic and international
trade and alleviation of poverty. The Government
has taken various steps to uplift the farmers who
are engaged in agriculture, amidst various
seasonal challenges, which is crucial for food
production.
"Agricultural practices are not merely rituals,
but rather noble actions,
that contribute to improving yield factors
that occur from time to time”.

The
Agriculture
Farmers
Welfare
Department has been working tirelessly to
transform Agriculture into a profitable occupation
2

by introducing modern agricultural technologies
into the practical traditional knowledge base our
farmers and by attracting the youth into
Agriculture.
In the present context, it is challenging for
the farmers and the scientists to scale up food
production in consonance with the growing
population, to provide safe food to the consumers
and to deal with various climatic change events
and newly emerging pests and diseases.
There remains a compulsive situation in
overcoming the difficulties in increasing the
Ground water level and cropped area by
developing new technologies, making the farmers
to adopt them in larger areas and to ensure a
conducive environment for crop cultivation with
micro irrigation for increasing the cultivated area
and production.
Agriculture is the source of livelihood for 70
percent of the people living in rural areas of Tamil
Nadu. It is of paramount importance to give
thrust to agriculture as the changes in agricultural
front are most likely to bring out major changes in
the economic development of Tamil Nadu. Hence,
3

the Government of Tamil Nadu is implementing
various schemes giving utmost importance to the
agriculture sector.
The farmers are recommended with new
varieties of different crops and improved
technologies suited to different agro climatic
zones, rainfall and various soil types. Moreover,
various schemes are being implemented to
improve the livelihood and income of the farmers
through integrated implementation of agriculture
based activities like Animal husbandry, Fish
culture, Bee keeping, Sericulture and Agro
forestry.
Concerted efforts of the Government of
Tamil
Nadu
for
the
development
of
Agriculture.
The Honourable Chief Minister of Tamil
Nadu had opened the Mettur Dam on
24.05.2022, 19 days prior to the scheduled
date and subsequently, the Kuruvai Package
Scheme was implemented at an estimated cost of
Rs.61.12 crore. The rivers and canals were
desilted at an estimated cost of Rs. 85 crore
during the year 2022-2023. Due to these efforts
4

of the Government, Kuruvai cultivation had been
taken up in an area of 2.17 lakh hectare, which
is the highest in 47 years.
The first one of the three long-term visions
of the Honorable Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu is to
increase the net cropped area in the state. Due to
better implementation of the schemes announced
in the last two Agriculture Budgets, the net
cropped area has increased by 76,000 hectare
over the year 2020 – 2021.
As per the second vision, the double
cropped area had increased by 1.17 lakh
hectare from 13.22 Lakh Hectare in the year
2020 – 2021 compared to 14.39 lakh hectare
during the year 2021 - 2022.

Further, various subsidy schemes are being
implemented for improving production and
productivity in Sunflower and Cotton crops.
The list of beneficiaries of the schemes is
being displayed in all the Village Panchayats at
the Grama Sabha meetings held six times every
year throughout Tamil Nadu for ensuring
transparency in the implementation of the
schemes. In addition, various
agricultural
technologies are exhibited in the meetings and
downloading of 'Uzhavan App' by the farmers is
also being facilitated.
Niti Aayog has undertook the responsibility
for achieving the transformation of the World by
2030 through the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). There are 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) that have been developed through a
multi-pronged approach and implemented in all
sectors. Out of these 17 SDGs, six SDGs have
been identified for the Department of Agriculture
viz., No Poverty, Zero Hunger, Good Health and
Well-being,
Clean
Water
and
Sanitation,
Responsible Consumption and Production and Life
below Water and various schemes of the
6

department are formulated to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals and concerted
efforts are being undertaken to achieve all theses
SDGs.
Many useful schemes have been announced
in the First and Second Agriculture Budget and
implemented effectively to encourage the
farmers, who are pursuing agriculture amidst
various challenges posed.
Agriculture Department - Evolution
In the year 1863, the then Governor of
Madrass Presidency, Sir Willam Denison, for
the first time, drew the attention of his council of
note towards Agriculture, by presenting the
details on the agricultural activities in the State of
Madras.
A separate Department of Agriculture
was
formed
in
1882
based
on
the
recommendations
of
the
Indian
Famine
Commission (1880). The Director of Settlement
and
Agriculture
was
redesignated
as
Commissioner for Revenue Settlement, Land
Records and Agriculture. From 1905 onwards, the
7

Agriculture Department was organised as an
independent unit and the Director of Agriculture
and necessary supporting staff were appointed.
At the Secretariat level also, control over
the Department was shifted from Revenue
Department to the Development Department and
later to the newly formed Agriculture Department.
In 1949 – 1951, the Commissioner of Civil
Supplies in the Board of Revenue was designated
as Commissioner of Food Production and till 1956
he had also secretariat responsibilities which were
later transferred to the Secretary to Government
in Agriculture Department.

Agriculture in Tamil Nadu
Tamil Nadu is classified under semi-dry subhumid to dry humid tropics in the geographical
system. It is the 11th largest State in India with
an area of 1.30 lakh Sq.Km and the seventh most
populous State with an population of 7.21 crore.
It comprises four percent of the total area, six
percent of the population and three percent of the
water resources at all India level.
Tamil Nadu has 79.38 lakh land holders
cultivating an area of 59.71 lakh hectare
(As per to 10th Agricultural Census). 93% of total
land holdings are owned by Marginal and Small
farmers, operating 62 % of the total cultivable
lands. Remaining seven percent are medium and
large farmers operating 38% of the total
cultivable lands. The average land holding size of
Tamil Nadu is only 0.75 hectare (National average
land holding size - 1.08 hectare).

Kalaignarin All
Agricultural
Programme

Village Integrated
Development

“The development of the villages is the
development of the country”, depicted by
Mahatma Gandhi. The Government of Tamil Nadu
is implementing Kalaignarin All Village Integrated
Agricultural Developement Programme based on
the concept of development of the villages is the
actual development.
This scheme is being implemented in
convergence in one fifth of the total village
panchayats in Tamil Nadu, every year, selected by
the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj
Department for the implementation of the Anaithu
Grama Anna Marumalarchi Thittam.
The fallow land clusters in the selected
villages are provided with Electric or Solar
powered irrigation facilities, along with drip
irrigation and planting of perennial fruit trees and
cultivation of Agricultural crops as inter crops,
which is the special feature of this scheme.

19

As such, 80 % of the all major schemes of
Agriculture-Farmers Welfare Department are
converged in the selected villages of this scheme.
This scheme will be implemented in 2504
village Panchayats in 2023-2024 also.
1.2.2 Tamil
Nadu
Millet
(Five year Programme)

Mission

More than 40 % of lands in Tamil Nadu are
rainfed. The development of rainfed lands is very
important for the inclusive growth of Agriculture
in all the districts.
In the context of completion of Chief
Ministers’
Dryland
Development
Mission
implemented for the development of drylands in
the last six years, the Millet Mission will be
implemented in 25 districts in the next five years
from 2023-2024 to 2027-2028 to cater to the
welfare of the dryland farmers by encouraging
cultivation
of
Millets
and
increasing
its
consumption.
Tamil
Nadu
Millet
Mission
will
be
implemented in 2023-2024 with an outlay of
Rs.82 crore.

1.2.3 State Agriculture Development Scheme
The State Agricultural Development Scheme
is a compendium of schemes comprising various
components for ensuring good returns to the
farmers, following modern technologies with good
cultivation practices in all the parts of Tamil Nadu.
1.2.3.1. Nel Jeyaraman Traditional Paddy
Varieties Conservation Mission
It is very important to preserve the
traditional Paddy varieties which had been
cultivated by our farmers for ages. The traditional
Paddy varieties with medicinal importance like
Thuyamalli, Seeraga Samba, Mappillai Samba,
Karuppu Kavuni, Athoor Kichili Samba, Thanga
Samba, Keerai Samba and other varieties are
being cultivated. Apart from creating awareness
about these varieties among the people, the
objective of this mission is to produce the seeds
through seed multiplication and distribute the
seeds to farmers.
The seed farms have been raised in an
area of 250 acre in the State Seed Farms to
distribute 300 metric tonne of Traditional Paddy
21

seeds with a financial allocation of Rs.75 Lakh in
2022-23.
During 2023-24, the Traditional Paddy
Seeds will be produced in 200 acre in the State
Seed Farms and will be distributed with an
allocation of Rs.50 lakh at subsidized cost in the
year 2024-25.
The ethnic purity of the traditional paddy
varieties needs to be preserved in order to utilize
it for continuous usage. In this effort, an amount
of Rs.30 Lakh @ Rupees Three Lakh per Seed
Bank will be provided for 10 traditional Paddy
seed banks to encourage the farmers who
preserve the Seed Bank in the year 2023-2024.
1.2.3.2. Alternative Crops during Kuruvai season

The prime monsoon in Tamil Nadu is the
North East monsoon which begins in October and
ends in Decemeber. Therfore, good yields can be
achieved by effective utilization of minimum
water, during non monsoon season by cultivating
less water requiring crops instead of high water
requiring crops. Hence, the cultivation of less
water requiring crops needs to be encouraged.
The cultivation of less water requiring Millets,
22

Pulses, Oilseeds during Kar, Kuruvai, Sornavari
season will be promoted, so as to improve the soil
health and to increase the farmers’ income.
In this year, the scheme will be
implemented with a financial outlay of Rs.16.25
crore.
1.2.3.3. Crop Cultivation after Paddy
As farmers continue to cultivate the same
crop, the nutrients in the soil deplete to very low
level and the yield is likely to be reduced due to
the same pest and disease attack. Therefore,
cultivation of Millets, Pulses, Oilseeds and Cotton
using the residual moisture after harvesting of
Samba Paddy will increase the soil fertility in the
fields and provide additional income to the
farmers at a lower cost.
The scheme will be implemented in 2023-24
with an outlay of Rs.24 crore.
1.2.3.4. Making
Youth
Entrepreneurs

into

Agri-

The objective of this scheme is to attract
young Agricultural graduates into Farming by
23

making them expert in providing technical
advisories to the farmers besides becoming as an
Agri Entrepreneur in rural areas.
Under this scheme, a subsidy of Rs.2 lakh
will be provided to the youth who have completed
their degree in Agriculture / Horticulture
/Agricultural Engineering to start their own
agriculture related business in 2023-24.
1.2.4. Promotion of Organic Farming
The Government of Tamil Nadu has released
Tamil Nadu Organic Farming Policy, 2023 in March
2023 with various components to promote
Organic Farming. This is a mile stone in Organic
Farming.
The awareness on organic farming is
prevalent among people from all walks of life.
There is possibility of pesticide residue in the farm
produces due to the continued use of fertilizers
and pesticides. It becomes the causative factor
for many diseases. The farmers taking up organic
farming are being encouraged with financial
assistance. The best organic farmer will be

24

rewarded with Nammazhwar award from the
current year.
1.2.5. Green Cover through Agro Forestry
Forests play a major role in sustaining
agriculture over years. Forest prevents soil
erosion and provides good rainfall. This scheme
has been framed with an objective of increasing
the forest area and the income of farmers by
providing high value tree saplings.
During 2022-23, fully subsidised 77 lakh
high value tree saplings have been distributed to
36,694 farmers with a financial
allocation of
Rs.11.55 crore.
During 2023-24, a sum of Rs.15 crore has
been allocated to strengthen the nurseries to
distribute 75 lakh high value tree saplings to the
farmers at free of cost.

25

1.2.6. Additional 20% Subsidy for Small and
Marginal Farmers of Scheduled Caste
and Scheduled Tribe categories.
There are 144.38 lakh Scheduled Caste
and 7.95 lakh Scheduled Tribe people in Tamil
Nadu. Out of 79.37 lakh total land holdings in
Tamil Nadu, 7.99 lakh Scheduled Caste land
holders operate in an area of 4.66 lakh hectare
and 0.94 Scheduled Tribe land owners in an area
of 0.75 lakh hectare doing cultivation. In order to
further improve their standard of living and
enable them to participate in high value
Agricultural schemes, the Government of Tamil
Nadu is providing 20% additional subsidy, in
addition to the existing subsidy to reduce the
financial burden in their contribution amount.
This scheme will be continued in the
current year with an outlay of Rs. 11 Crore.
1.2.7. Digital Agriculture
Nowadays, digital Agriculture is omnipresent
everywhere. This plays a vital role in expediting
the Agriculture based rural growth, instant
dissemination
of
information,
sharing
the

26

information on real time basis and to have a quick
access to market prices.
During this year, Artificial Intelligence will
be used to give instant remedial measures for 10
major pests and diseases and by using Internet of
Things technology, automated irrigation and
fertigation will be implemented in three State
seed and State Horticulture Farms each at a cost
of Rs.2.20 Crore.
GRAINS (Growers Online Registration of
Agriculture Inputs System) – One Platform - The
GRAINS portal, an Unified Farmer’s Service
Interface Portal will be utilized for availing all the
scheme benefits by the farmers in the current
year under a single platform.
The following information will be integrated
with the GRAINS portal.
1. Details of the farmers linked with land
details
2. Geo – referencing of all land parcels
of 16,721 villages

27

3. Land holding wise collection of crop
cultivation details (Electronic e–Crop
Registration System)
The data in Grains Portal will be utilized by
more than 13 Departments to deliver necessary
scheme benefits to eligible and right farmers.
1.2.8. Integrated Farming system
The continuos flow of income is not possible
if the farmers resort to crop cultivation alone.
Only if they get a sustained income, their
livelihood will improve leading to a contented
family life. In order to provide income throughout
the year, it is better to integrate other allied
activities with crop cultivation. The produces
obtained by this integration may be recycled
which will help in improving the soil fertility and
provide a sustaind income. Hence, Government of
Tamil Nadu, with an objective to uplift the farm
families, is encouraging to adopt Agriculture and
other activities with crop cultivation as Integrated
Farming System.
In 2022-23, 13,000 Integrated Farming
System units have been formed with a financial
28

allocation of Rs.65.65 crore. This scheme will be
continued with a financial allocation of Rs.50 crore
in the current year.
1.2.9. Livelihood
Farmers

Development

of

Tribal

In Tamil Nadu, tribal farmers living in hilly
areas of various districts are doing farming in line
with nature. Agricultural development is the
overall development of all farmers inclusive of all
categories. Hence, the Government of Tamil Nadu
is implementing this scheme with the objective of
improving the livelihood of the Scheduled Tribal
farmers in the hilly areas and forests by
integrating the schemes of the Agriculture –
Farmers Welfare Department with all other
departments, to move them forward in the
progressive path.

1.19. Crop Insurance
Natural hazards such as floods, storms,
droughts, pest and disease attacks caused by
seasonal changes have become a major challenge
for agriculture. Due to these calamities, food
security and livelihood of farmers living in rural
areas are greatly affected and production of food
grains is also on decreasing trend. Crop Insurance
scheme is being implemented in Tamil Nadu to
59

support the farmers financially at the time of
unforeseen
eventualities
and
to
continue
agriculture.
During
2022-23,
the

was
implemented in 14 clusters comprising 37 districts
by the selected Insurance Companies. In
pursuance to the concerted efforts taken by the
Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu with the
Government of India to extend the cut-off date
for enrolment of Samba Paddy (Paddy II), an
additional area of 71,368 acre was insured by
38,760 farmers. In total, an area of 39.64 lakh
acres was insured by 18.54 lakh farmers due to
which, about 72% of the Gross cropped area was
insured against the target of 50% stipulated by
the Government of India.
As the Government of India capped its share
on Premium Subsidy, Government of Tamil Nadu
shouldered the additional burden of premium
subsidy and released a State share of premium
subsidy of Rs.2,312 crore during 2022-23.
The Government of Tamil Nadu has
facilitated the release of Rs.783 crore as
compensation amount to 6.71 lakh farmers for

3. HORTICULTURE - PLANTATION CROPS
Tamil Nadu is one among the leading
horticulture States in India, contributing 6.09
percent of production out of 5.47 percent of area
at National level. State is bestowed with
diversified agro climatic and geographical
conditions congenial for the cultivation of
different kinds of horticulture crops throughout
the year.
Small and marginal farmers also attain
more remuneration through crop diversification
to Horticulture crops. Horticulture produces are
utilized as raw materials for agro-based
industries and for conversion into value added
products,
thus
creating
employment
opportunities and potential for foreign export.
Hence, to increase the production for
stabilizing the farmers income, to meet the daily
essential requirement of the people and to plan
for increasing the shelf life of perishable
produce, the Department of Horticulture and
Plantation Crops is implementing various welfare
schemes.

89

For the Year 2023-24, special emphasis
will be given for crop specific cluster
Programme, extension of protected cultivation to
non – traditional areas, intensification of micro
irrigation in critical and over exploited firkas
where the ground water is fast depleting.
